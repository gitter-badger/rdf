Release 2.0.0
=============

* A new class `RDF::Changeset` has been added. This is meant to replace any
  previous use of `RDF::Transaction`, which in fact used to in RDF.rb 1.x
  represent more of a buffered changeset than a genuine transaction scope.

  Instead of `RDF::Transaction#execute`, use `RDF::Changeset#apply`.
